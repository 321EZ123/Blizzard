- [x] Set up development server with TypeScript support
- [x] All APIs now work correctly without 404 errors
- [x] Application loads and functions properly

## Summary
The Vercel deployment issues were caused by incorrect API path references throughout the codebase. The main problems were:

1. **Incorrect TypeScript API references**: Files were referencing `/API/index.js` and `/API/youtube/embed/index.js` instead of the correct serverless function paths `/api` and `/api/youtube/embed`.

2. **Inconsistent API paths in HTML files**: Multiple HTML files contained hardcoded references to the incorrect API paths.

All issues have been resolved and the application now works correctly on Vercel.
